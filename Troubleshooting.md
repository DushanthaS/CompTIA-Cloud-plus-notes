            entries, dashboards, and alerts.

        -   Expanding analysis to encompass all relevant channels.

        -   Decision-making: performing backups if necessary.

2.  **Establishing a Theory of Probable Cause**

    -   Factors involved in formulating a probable cause theory:

        -   Analyzing change management history.

        -   Starting with simple and obvious causes.

        -   Gathering information from users and staff.

        -   Checking for commonality across multiple inputs.

        -   Understanding the potential scope or blast radius of the
            issue.

3.  **Testing the Theory**

    -   Developing and executing tests to validate the probable cause
        theory:

        -   Creating one or more tests for verification.

        -   Executing the tests to confirm or discard the theory.

4.  **Confirmation or Iteration**

    -   Outcome after testing the theory:

        -   Confirming the theory and proceeding with the determined
            problem and solution.

    destination host and returned.

-   **Symptoms**:

    -   Hangs or times out: Destination down or blocked by a firewall.

    -   \"Destination host unreachable\": Network configuration on
        source host prevents reachability.

**2. TraceRoute (Linux) / TraceRt.exe (Windows)**

-   **Purpose**: Determines the network path packets take to reach a
    destination.

-   **Usage**: **traceroute \<hostname or IP\>** (Linux) or **tracert
    \<hostname or IP\>** (Windows).

**3. nslookup**

-   **Purpose**: Translates hostnames to IP addresses and validates DNS
    reachability.

-   **Usage**: **nslookup \<hostname\>** (can also ping a hostname for
    nslookup).

**4. route**

-   **Purpose**: Displays and manages local routes on both Linux and
    Windows.

**5. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**

-   **Purpose**: Views the local cache of MAC addresses and their
    association with IP addresses.

**6. curl / wget**

-   **Purpose**: Operates at the application layer (Layer 7) to test
    website connectivity and download files.

-   **Usage**: **curl \<URL\>** or **wget \<URL\>**.

**7. Packet Capturing (Wireshark / TCPdump)**

-   **Purpose**: Captures and analyzes network traffic, including packet
    contents.

-   **Considerations**: In public clouds like AWS, this type of traffic
    may be blocked.

    -   Options include configuring packet mirroring, using a gateway
        load balancer, or forwarding traffic to backend appliances.

**8. OpenSSL**

-   **Purpose**: Inspects SSL and TLS certificates, verifies SSL
    connections.
